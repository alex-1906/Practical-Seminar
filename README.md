# Practical-Seminar

In this repository I attempt to build a dashboard for a movie recommender system. Using the 45k MovieLens Dataset.
The goal of the seminar is explaining the movie recommendations by displaying a user profile (influence of each film on the recommendations).

TODO:
  - [x] user can be selected in the dashboard
  - [ ] content-based recommender system based on categories
  - [ ] display the user preferences for each category
  - [ ] display the recommendations for user
  - [ ] get the influence scores of each movie rated by the user
  - [ ] display the influence profile
  - [ ] usage description
  - [ ] repository description


  - [ ] get IMDB movie posters for each movie in profile and display on dashboard
  - [ ] content-based recommender system based on plot, using with tfidf
